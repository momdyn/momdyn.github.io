Rigid Translation
=================

A rigid translation creates a point that is translated relative to an existing point with vector components defined in a specified reference frame. The rigid translation is analogous to creating a vector and point using the classic interface.

**Keyword Arguments**

:param str name: Name given to the rigid translation, default is uppercase characters in alphabetical order (A, B, C, ...)

:param str ref_point_key: Start point from which the vector component of the rigid translation is defined

:param str ref_frame_key: Reference frame in which the components of the vector are defined, with basis vectors e_x, e_y, and e_z

**Vector Components**

:param numeric x: Component of the unit vector measured in the x-axis of the reference frame

:param numeric y: Component of the unit vector measured in the y-axis of the reference frame

:param numeric z: Component of the unit vector measured in the z-axis of the reference frame
