Rigid Rotation
==============

A rigid rotation creates a frame that is oriented relative to an existing frame by a Euler angle sequence.

**Keyword Arguments**

:param str name: Name given to the rigid rotation, default is uppercase characters in alphabetical order (A, B, C, ...)

:param str ref_point_key: Point where the frame is visualized

:param str ref_frame_key: Reference frame from which the orientation of the new frame is defined relative to

**Vector Components**

:param numeric first_angle: First angle in the sequence in radians

:param numeric second_angle: Second angle in the sequence in radians

:param numeric third_angle: Third angle in the sequence in radians
