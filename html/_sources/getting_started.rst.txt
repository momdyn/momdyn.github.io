Getting Started
===============

Welcome to the help documentation for MOMDYN. This page gives an overview of the user interface in the app. Here we
will introduce tutorials that introduce the basics of building a dynamics model. This is followed by a discussion of
the screens in the app, and some of the details of the interface. For detail on the physical components, check out the
section on the `Mechanism Module <mechanism.html>`_.

Tutorials
---------

Below are examples of a simple pendulum and mass-spring-damper. These are standard models that are taught in
introductory to intermediate dynamics coursework, and are used to teach the fundamentals of kinematic definition with
translational and rotations motions, and equation of motion generation for specified bodies and loads. The tutorials
introduce definition of the models using the classic interface, followed by joints to define kinematics

Welcome Screen

The first screen you see, with a picture of MOM, and the three basic options, "Create," "Import," or "Website." Tap on
the first button to bring up the settings dialog, where you will configure a new model. Tap on the second button to
bring up the import dialog, with a list of pre-created examples that are packaged with MOMDYN, as well as any models
you have saved as a user. Lastly, tap on the third button to link to the MOMDYN website.

Diagram View

The primary screen for interacting with the model, including updating settings, saving and exporting, adding model
components, and visualizing. Drag in the center of the screen to move the model, and use the buttons in the upper right
to autoscale, zoom in, or zoom out. The menu button in the lower right brings up settings/save buttons, and expansion
panels for each of the dynamics modeling components. The play button in the lower left is used to derive equations of
motion (EOM), simulate, and start animations. Tap on the slider bar on the bottom to reposition the animation in time.

Report View
-----------

Provides text and mathematical insights important to the dynamicist. At the top of the screen are several buttons which
each direct to a different set of report data. Start with the symbolic variables, including the time varying
generalized coordinates and speeds, and the constant parameters. Next are the kinematics, including rotating reference
frames, vectors, and points. This is followed by the bodies and loads. Finally, once the model has been defined, you
may derive EOM which are viewed with the second to last button, and with these EOM run a simulation with plotted data
shown with the last button.
