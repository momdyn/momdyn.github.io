General Rigid Body
==================

A general rigid body has its center of gravity (CG) located at a user-specified point and orientation defined in a specified frame, a fixed mass, and specified inertia tensor.

**Keyword Arguments**

:param str name: Key to be used when referencing this body.

:param str ref_point_key: Key of the point at which this body's CG is located.

:param str ref_frame_key: ey of the frame to which this body orientation is defined.

:param numeric mass: Mass of this body.

:param numeric ixx: Moment of inertia (MOI) of this body defined relative to its CG about the reference frame's X-axis.

:param numeric iyy: MOI of this body defined relative to its CG about the reference frame's Y-axis.

:param numeric izz: MOI of this body defined relative to its CG about the reference frame's Z-axis.

:param str ixy: Product of inertia (POI) of this body defined relative to its CG in the reference frame's X- and Y-axes.

:param str iyz: POI of this body defined relative to its CG in the reference frame's Y- and Z-axes.

:param str izx: POI of this body defined relative to its CG in the reference frame's Z- and X-axes.

:return str: Message about the created body
