**Screen selector**

Switch between the welcome screen, diagram view, and report view.

**Action button**

Initially will be a chevron-right icon. Once a model is defined, tap once to derive equations of motion, once complete
the icon will change to an outlined play icon. Tap again to simulate, once complete the icon will change to a filled
play icon. Tap again to animate.

**Zoom out, zoom in, autoscale**

Updates the size of the model in the diagram view. Autoscale will detect the extreme positioning of any component to
set the zoom scale, and center the model in the screen.

**Switch 3-D to 2-D**

Change the view from the default 3-Dimensional rendering to a 2-Dimensional annotated schematic of the model.

**Menu button**

Opens the menu drawer. Alternately, can drag from the left edge of the screen.
