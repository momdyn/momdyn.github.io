Import Dialog
=============

The import dialog displays a list of models that may be loaded as the working file. Items marked 'examples' are pre-packaged with MOMDYN, whereas items marked 'user' are those that you have generated yourself. To import a file, tap that item in the list, then tap the check mark in the lower right. If you choose not to import a model, tap the check mark in the upper right to close.
