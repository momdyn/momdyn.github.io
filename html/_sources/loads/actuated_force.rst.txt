**Keyword Arguments**

:param str name: Name given to the force.

:param str ref_frame_key: Reference frame in which the vector components of the force are defined.

:param str start_point: First point upon which the force acts.

:param str end_point: Second point upon which the force acts, with negative magnitude.

:param numeric force: Force magnitude.

:param numeric x: X-component of the vector aligned with the force.

:param numeric y: Y-component of the vector aligned with the force.

:param numeric z: Z-component of the vector aligned with the force.
