Generalized Speed
=================

A generalized speed is a symbolic variable representing the mechanism motion. It is common to equate a generalized speed to the first derivative of a corresponding generalized speed with respect to time, however, this is not required. In fact, a more compact form of equations of motion are often obtained by using an alternate set of generalized speeds, for example, in free motion of a rigid body it is common to define generalized coordinates as positions relative to the origin in the inertial frame, with generalized speeds being the velocity components in the body-fixed frame.

**Keyword Arguments**

:param str name: Key to be used when referencing this coordinate in the mechanism.q dictionary. Can be entered using LaTeX symbol formatting, i.e. \omega yields Ï‰, etc.

:param str equates_to: Equation representing terms in the point velocity or frame angular velocity equations that will be replaced by this generalized speed.

:param numeric initial: Initial value for the generalized speed

:param str description: Description of the generalized speed

:return str: Message describing the created generalized speed
