Generalized Coordinate
======================

A generalized coordinate is a symbolic variable representing the mechanism configuration, typically as either a length or angular dimension. It is time-varying, and is alternately termed a degree of freedom. When using the classic interface, the generalized coordinate dialog is used to create the symbolic variable, which is later selected in the frame or vector dialogs as a dimension.

**Keyword Arguments**

:param str name: string Key to be used when referencing this coordinate in the mechanism.q dictionary. Can be entered using LaTeX symbol formatting, i.e. \theta yields Î¸, etc

:param numeric initial: Initial value for the generalized coordinate

:param str description: Description of the generalized coordinate

:return str: Message describing the created generalized coordinate
